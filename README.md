# Sales-Case-Study

**Introduction**

I was working on a sales case stugy whereby i was anaylysing one product for the compnay. I was evalauting whethre the product is making a profit.

**Insights**

The cost of sales were high than revnue indicating that the product was making a loss. The qanuity that was sold dropped when the prices increased. This incidicated that the product was price elastic.The customers are price sensitive. The recommendations suggested are that the prices set was not able to recover the costs. Pricing strategy which would be suitable is discount pricing or they would have to reduce the directly attibutable costs. 

**Tools used**

I used mirohub in order to plan how to tackle the analysis of the sales case study. 
I used data bricks in order to clean the data. I downloaded the excel file from the data bricks. I used the clean data in order tp create graphs on power bi. I used the graphs to create a PowerPoint Presentation.
